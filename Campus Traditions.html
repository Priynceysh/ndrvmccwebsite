<p align="center"><font size="12">Campus Traditions</font></p>

<p>Traditions are practices unique to a group and regularly done to create an identity that transcends differences. The experiences resulting from the varied practices instill the feeling of belonging, being one of them regardless of ones individuality and the power of a force motivated by objectives for the good of the school in particular and the students in general, thereby contributing to the bigger society.</p>

<p>Being an Ignacian-Marian graduate of a Catholic Filipino School, ND-RVMCC, makes one distinct and set apart from the other graduates.</p>

 

<p align="center"><font size="8">Religious Formation</font></p>

<p>Notre Dame  RVM College of Cotabato is a Catholic institution that accepts students belonging to other religious affiliations that uphold the philosophy, vision, mission and objectives of the school. For the Catholic students, the school has a program of Religious Formation that considers classroom experiences and on-and-off religious activities. Ignacian  Marian values are integrated in the lessons which are enriched by activities like:</p>

        <p>Eucharistic celebration on Sundays, first Fridays and holy days of obligations;</p>
       <p> Sacrament of Reconciliation or Confession;</p>
     <p> Annual Recollection and Retreats;</p>
       <p> Celebrations of the feasts of the Blessed Virgin Mary;</p>
        <p>October devotion;</p>
      <p>  Class formation in the Christian Living classes; and</p>
       <p> Periodic calls for prayer, Bible services, prayer sessions, other liturgical services, and vigils.</p>

 

<p>The non-Christian students have their Islamic session, their Sambayang on Fridays and symposium on scheduled dates.</p>

 

<p align="center"><font size="8">Marian Tradition</font></p>

<p>The patroness of the school is the Blessed Virgin Mary who is also the model and inspiration of the schools foundress, Venerable Ignacia del Espiritu Santo.</p>

<p>As students of ND-RVMCC, all the students look up to Mary as model of Marian values and follow her spirit of service for others. Her feast days are celebrated and devotions to her are encouraged and promoted.</p>

<p>Notre Dame (Our Lady) is part of the schools name so all Notre Damers owe it to the Blessed Lady to promote her and be witnesses of her Marian values.</p>

 

<p align="center"><font size="8">MIDES Tradition</font></p>

<p>The Venerable Ignacia del Espiritu Santo is the foundress of the school. It is but proper that all students must participate in all activities held in the honor of the foundress such as her baptismal and death anniversaries, the Ignacian Formation activities, reach-out activities, inter-school competition and socializations and other such activities.</p>

 

<p align="center"><font size="8">Filipino Spirit</p></font>

<p>ND-RVMCC is a Filipino school founded by a Filipino, administered by Filipino Religious Sisters and Lay leaders and assisted by Filipino teachers. The curriculum includes offerings rich in Filipino culture, values, arts, context and traditions making students proud being a Filipino and promoter the spirit at home, in school, the community and the would at large.</p>
